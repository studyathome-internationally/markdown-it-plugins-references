# Markup

::: attribution wiki:markdown|(Page 1),wiki:asciidoc

Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain-text-formatting syntax, created in 2004 by John Gruber with Aaron Swartz.
Markdown is often used for formatting readme files, for writing messages in online discussion forums, and to create rich text using a plain text editor.

AsciiDoc is a human-readable document format, semantically equivalent to DocBook XML, but using plain-text mark-up conventions.
AsciiDoc documents can be created using any text editor and read “as-is”, or rendered to HTML or any other format supported by a DocBook tool-chain, i.e. PDF, TeX, Unix manpages, e-books, slide presentations, etc.
